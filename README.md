# Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Cubical Complexes for Image Analysis

This repository contains code for applying **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** using **cubical complexes** to analyze image data. The approach leverages topological features to extract meaningful insights from images, suitable for research in computational topology, image processing, and data science.

## 🛠 Requirements

All required packages and dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  
This enables users to create a separate, isolated environment to run the code reliably.

To set up the environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
